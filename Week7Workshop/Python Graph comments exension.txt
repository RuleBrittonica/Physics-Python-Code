Python week 7 extension brief comments on the graph

The graph has three large peaks, each with a maximum displacement reaching 
around 4.4 - 4.6. Apart from that, the graph bounces slightly above and slightly
below 1.4, likely averaging somewhere around this point. 
The graph starts out with very rapid but small changes in maximum displacement, 
but as the period approaches 12, the changes become both more gradual and larger.
The third peak occurs at double the period of the first peak, suggesting that
the underlying maths produces regular peaks in maximum displacement, although
a larger range of T would be required to check if this is the case.
